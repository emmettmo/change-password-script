# Change server passwords

This script is designed to take input from a file of all the servers you want changed and automatically change their passwords and store said passwords in pass.

This script is made in python and needs only one pre-requisite
--Paramiko
You can install paramiko via ``pip install paramiko``

##IMPORTANT
This accepts servers in the form of just names, this can be easily changed by commenting out the line in the change.py file that says CHANGE ME and replacing the server list with url lists.
I.E going from google to google.com
