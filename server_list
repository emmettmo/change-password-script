#Enter server and then the users to change seperated by a space
#Keep in mind some servers CANNOT ssh in via root so you will have to manually
#change that if you need to
#
#Example (blackadder is the name of one of our servers)
#blackadder sysadmin user1 user2
#OR
#blackadder.com sysadmin user1 user2
#^this is if you wish to enter url's instead of names, make sure to change code
#accordingly
